# Downstream - ASP.NET Core IT Ticketing System

This is a work in progress project for CodeLouisville's Software Development II course. While I will continue to work on this as a personal project, as of 11/17/22 this meets the requirements for the course.

 - Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used in your application.
 - Choose at least 3 items on the Features List below and implement them in your project
## Chosen Features from Project Requirements Document
 - Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
 - Make your application asynchronous
 - Add comments to your code explaining how you are using at least 2 of the solid principles
 - Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
